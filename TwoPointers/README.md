## ⚡ About This Repository

This repository documents my **DSA journey** — focused on the **Two Pointer Technique**,  
a must-know approach for optimizing array, subarray, and sorting-based problems.

✨ **Highlights:**
- Covers over **50+ problems** organized by logic level  
- Clean, structured **Java solutions**  
- Built for **interview preparation** and **pattern mastery**  
- Clear categorization from **Basic → Master level**

## 🟢 LEVEL 1 — BASIC UNDERSTANDING  
*Start–End | Simple Swap | Sorted Check*

| # | Problem |
|--|----------|
| 1 | Check if the array is a palindrome |
| 2 | Reverse the array in-place |
| 3 | Find if a pair with given sum K exists in a sorted array |
| 4 | Merge two sorted arrays into one sorted array |
| 5 | Move all negative numbers to the beginning (order not important) |
| 6 | Move all zeroes to the end (maintaining order) |
| 7 | Find the first pair with a given difference K in a sorted array |
| 8 | Find the minimum difference between any two elements in a sorted array |
| 9 | Find the index of the pair whose sum is closest to a target |
| 10 | Find the second largest element using two-pointer traversal |
| 11 | Separate even and odd numbers in-place |
| 12 | Reverse array in groups of K |
| 13 | Find max and min using minimum comparisons (Tournament Method) |

## 🟡 LEVEL 2 — INTERMEDIATE  
*Pattern Recognition | Sorting | Frequency Matching*

| # | Problem |
|--|----------|
| 1 | Remove duplicates from a sorted array (in-place) |
| 2 | Count the number of unique pairs with sum equal to K |
| 3 | Count the number of pairs with absolute difference equal to K |
| 4 | Find all pairs in a sorted array that sum to a given value |
| 5 | Find intersection of two sorted arrays |
| 6 | Sort an array of 0s, 1s, and 2s (Dutch National Flag) |
| 7 | Check if array can be partitioned into two equal sums (DP + HashSet) |
| 8 | Merge two sorted arrays without extra space (Gap Method) |
| 9 | Find closest pair from two sorted arrays whose sum is X |

---

## 🔴 LEVEL 3 — ADVANCED APPLICATION  
*Triplets | Optimization | Range Analysis*

---

## 💥 LEVEL 4 — MASTER LEVEL MIX  
*Two Pointer + DP Hybrid | Advanced Optimization*

| # | Problem |
|--|----------|
| 1 | Find the closest pair from two sorted arrays to a target sum |
| 2 | Four sum problem (find all quadruplets with sum equal to target) |
| 3 | Minimum swaps to bring all 1s together |
| 4 | Check if there exists a subarray of size K with a specific sum |
| 5 | Given a sorted array and value K, find ceiling and floor using two pointers |
| 6 | Find minimum distance between two numbers using 2-pointer simulation |
| 7 | Rotate array to the right by K steps |
| 8 | Count subarrays where difference between max and min ≤ K |
| 9 | Find max sum of subarray of size K |
| 10 | Find continuous subarrays that sum up to exactly K |
| 11 | Trapping Rain Water problem |
| 12 | Allocate minimum number of pages/books |
| 13 | Minimize maximum difference between heights after adding/subtracting K |
| 14 | Maximize sum of min pairs in an array |

## 🧠 Training Approach

For every question, I ask myself:
- 🧩 *Is the array sorted?*  
- 🔁 *Do I need a pair/triplet/subarray?*  
- ⚙️ *Am I modifying in-place?*  
- 🔍 *Which pointer variant fits best?*  
  - Start–End  
  - Slow–Fast  
  - Sliding Window
